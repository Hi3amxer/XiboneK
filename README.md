Jailbreak made for IOS 11-11.1.2
You for now will not be able to install any tweak because the cydia substrate for IOS 11 has not yet been updated.
What you have achieved so far basically was to have "cydia" installed ie it is la but still can not do anything with it until we can update the cydia substrate.
I'll leave here a link: https://www.cydiaupdates.org/ where there are all the tweaks where they are in DEB. Then just pass the DEB to IPA.
But remember that even if you pass these cydia impactor tweaks to your mobile phone, you will still be unable to use cydia programs such "tweaks"
If you want to try to make improvements you have the project above to work on it.
Note: It's only for developers, I'm not responsible if you have an accident on your computer iphone or mac.
  Good luck to everyone :)
